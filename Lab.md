# Lab Guide: OAuth 2.0 with Node.js

## 1. Introduction
In this lab, we will explore the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework using Node.js. We will learn about the OAuth 2.0 flow, how to implement an OAuth 2.0 server and client, and much more.

### Objectives of the Lab
- Understand the basics of OAuth 2.0.
- Learn how to implement an OAuth 2.0 server and client using Node.js.

## 2. Background
OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account and authorizing third-party applications to access the user account.

## 3. Pre-Lab Knowledge Check
Before we begin, let's ensure we understand the following concepts:
1. **OAuth 2.0**: It's an authorization framework that enables applications to obtain limited access to user accounts on an HTTP service.
2. **Node.js**: It's a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## 4. Safety and Ethics 
Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. This lab is for educational purposes only. Always respect privacy and consent when using these skills. It's crucial to understand that misuse of these skills can lead to serious consequences. Therefore, let's ensure we use our knowledge ethically and responsibly, promoting a safer digital world.

## 5. Submission Requirements
Please submit the following upon completion of the lab:
- Screenshots of your work
- This completed .md file
- Any configuration files used or modified
- All the source code

## 6. Procedure
### 6.1 Installation and Minimum Requirements
1. **Update your package list**: Open your terminal and run the following command to make sure your system is up-to-date:
    
    `sudo apt-get update`

2. **Install Node.js**: Kali Linux comes with Node.js in its repositories. You can install it by running:

    `sudo apt-get install nodejs`

3. **Verify the installation**: Check the installed version of Node.js by running:
  
    `node -v`
  
4. **Install npm (Node Package Manager)**: npm is the package manager for Node.js and is necessary for installing Node.js modules. You can install it by running:

    `sudo apt-get install npm`
    
5. **Verify npm installation**: Check the installed version of npm by running:
    
    `npm -v`

For the local development environment, the recommended settings are:
- **Operating System**: Kali Linux
- **RAM**: At least 4 GB
- **Hard Disk Space**: At least 20 GB
- **Software**: Node.js and npm installed

Remember to replace `apt-get` with `apt` if you are using a newer version of Kali Linux. Also, you might need to use `nodejs -v` instead of `node -v` to check the Node.js version, depending on your Kali Linux version. If you want to use `node -v`, you can create a symbolic link between `node` and `nodejs` by running `sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node`. This is because, in some versions of Linux, the binary is named `nodejs` instead of `node` due to a naming conflict.


### 6.2 Implementing OAuth 2.0 Server

#### Step 1: Create a new Node.js project
Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with npm:

`mkdir oauth-server`

`cd oauth-server`

`npm init -y`

#### Step 2: Install the necessary packages
Install the necessary packages (express, crypto, etc.):

`npm install express dotenv https fs path crypto express-session`

# Step 3: Create a .env file
Create a .env file in your project root directory to store environment variables:

`touch .env`

Open the .env file and add the following lines:

`AUTH_CODE=your_auth_code`

`VALID_REDIRECT_URIS=url`

Replace your_auth_code and url with your actual values.

#### Step 4: Generate SSL Certificate for HTTPS
To set up HTTPS, you need to generate a self-signed SSL certificate. Run the following command:

`openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes`

>This will create two files in your directory, key.pem (the private key) and cert.pem (the certificate).Make sure to give proper authorization to all the files and directories. You can set the permissions of the key file to be read and write only by the owner with the following command:

`sudo chmod 600 key.pem`

Handle Self-Signed Certificate Error
If you’re using axios, you might receive an error for the self-signed certificate. To handle this, you can set rejectUnauthorized to false. Here’s how you can do it:

`const httpsAgent = new https.Agent({
    rejectUnauthorized: false
});`
